<section class="section" id="ai-observability">
  <h2>AI-infused observability</h2>
  <p>AI initiatives succeed when the telemetry feeding models stays reliable. We instrument SQL Server, message buses, and data lakes so AI agents can trust the signal instead of guessing.</p>
  <p>Hooking Execution Plans, wait stats, and ingestion metrics into observability platforms gives the AI layer historical context before it makes decisions.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="responsible-ai">
  <h2>Responsible AI on the data platform</h2>
  <p>Responsible AI starts with governance, data contracts, and explanations. We pair SQL Server data lineage with model cards, guardrails, and human reviews to keep automation accountable.</p>
  <p>Transparent decision logs and fallbacks let operations teams intervene when a model drifts.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="operationalize-ai">
  <h2>Operationalizing AI for databases</h2>
  <p>From embedding models that power documentation search to AI-assisted incident triage, each automaton layers on the core data platform. SQL Server tuning, ETL orchestration, and change data capture feed the AI pipelines.</p>
  <p>We codify automation in playbooks so every AI experiment follows the same reliability guardrails.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="ai-reading">
  <h2>AI & learning journeys</h2>
  <p>Ongoing reading—including the LinkedIn post “From Mythology to AI: My Reading Journey of the Year”—shapes how I translate emerging capabilities into actionable architecture changes.</p>
  <p>Documenting that journey keeps the team aligned on what’s experimental versus production-ready.</p>
