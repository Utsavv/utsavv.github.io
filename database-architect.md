  <h2>How architects think</h2>
  <p>Architects start with boundary contexts, then layer systems thinking, risk mitigations, and resiliency requirements. The goal is a predictable platform that still allows incubation.</p>
  <p>Every design review includes data contracts, domain modeling, and clarity around telemetry so engineering teams can implement without guesswork.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="design-vs-implementation">
  <h2>Design vs implementation</h2>
  <p>Leadership means deciding when to stay in the architecture lane and when to roll up the sleeves. I help teams document API/contract requirements while also guiding hands-on tuning on critical paths.</p>
  <p>Documentation plus structured reviews ensure implementation fidelity and create a learning loop for the next project.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="migration-strategies">
  <h2>Migration strategies</h2>
  <p>Lift-and-shift on Azure SQL Managed Instance, refactor via containerized micro-services, or hybrid-cloud splits: each migration has a custom runway and governance checklist.</p>
  <p>Strategies include tiered cutover, parallel runways, data validation suites, and rollback triggers.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="lessons">
  <h2>Lessons from large migrations</h2>
  <p>Migrations teach discipline: invest in observability before the cutover, automate schema drift detection, and keep communication transparent. Lessons from 100+ database moves inform our default playbooks.</p>
  <p>Every migration includes retrospectives so the next decision is grounded in fact.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="mistakes">
  <h2>Architecture mistakes to avoid</h2>
  <p>Siloed data models, ignoring governance, and chasing the latest buzzword without business alignment are avoidable when architects insist on clarity and accountability.</p>
  <p>We record those anti-patterns in post-mortems and share them across teams so the lessons scale.</p>
