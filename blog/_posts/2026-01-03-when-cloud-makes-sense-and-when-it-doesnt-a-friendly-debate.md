title: "When Cloud Makes Sense—and When It Doesn’t: A Friendly Debate"
date: 2026-01-03
excerpt: "A conversation unpacking when clients should stay on-prem versus when a cloud-first move pays off."
---

Recently, I had a chat with a friend about the pros and cons of moving to the cloud, especially in the context of our customers and their database needs. It was a really interesting conversation because we both came at it from different angles.

On one hand, from our perspective—especially with our more established enterprise customers—cloud doesn't always make sense. Many of these clients have already invested heavily in their own strong database infrastructure. They have the manpower, the data centers, and they're dealing with massive volumes of transactions. For them, moving these huge workloads to the cloud could become very expensive and might not offer a clear performance benefit.

On the flip side, my friend—who's a security specialist—pointed out something I hadn't fully considered. From a security standpoint, cloud can actually be easier to manage at an enterprise level. He mentioned that cloud providers often handle a lot of the security patching and threat mitigation automatically. If one customer reports a threat, the fix rolls out to everyone, often before you even know about it. So there's definitely that side of the coin where cloud shines, especially when you're dealing with unpredictable usage or when you're just starting out and need that flexibility.

In the end, we agreed that both perspectives are valid. Cloud isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, and for some of our clients, staying on-prem is still the best route. For others, especially those who need that agility or have security needs that benefit from cloud automation, it makes a lot of sense.
