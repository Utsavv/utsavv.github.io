## Job hunting? Optimize your CV for AI

**Your one-page CV isn’t obsolete because it’s bad. It’s obsolete because the reader has changed.**

The CV was designed for one thing: helping a tired human scan you in 10 seconds. Bullet points, keywords, one page. That constraint shaped how we describe our work.

But today, the primary reader is often an AI system. These systems can process large amounts of text, retain context, and compare patterns across thousands of profiles without fatigue.

So the real question is:

**Why are we still writing CVs as if a human is skimming them?**

---

## CVs Are Built for Skimming, Not Understanding

The biggest problem with a CV isn’t exaggeration. It’s compression.

Real work is messy. You learn in fragments, solve vague problems, discard ideas, fail, recover, and slowly build intuition. Yet all of this gets flattened into lines like:

> “Worked on system optimization and performance improvements”

That sentence hides debugging marathons, self-learning, trade-offs, and growth over time.

Humans skim because they have to. AI doesn’t skim. It reasons over context.

## AI Doesn’t Need Brevity. It Needs Context.

Hiring AI systems don’t read CVs like humans. They turn text into representations and compare them with role requirements, team patterns, and historical success signals.

More context creates a stronger signal.

This allows AI to spot things humans miss: learning behavior, persistence, curiosity, and transferable skills.

For example, this rarely makes it into a CV:

> “Spent 40+ hours learning distributed systems through blogs, talks, and failed experiments”

There’s no space for it. But for AI, this signals self-driven learning and comfort with complexity.

Or what about that POC which did not prove hypothesis?

## Evidence: Hiring Is Already Moving Beyond the CV

This shift is already underway.

Across the industry:

* Work samples often predict performance better than resumes
* Keyword matching is giving way to structured skill profiles
* AI-assisted shortlisting happens before human review

The CV is no longer the decision-maker. It’s becoming a weak proxy.

## The Future CV Is a Narrative

When the reader can handle long-form input, depth becomes an advantage.

Instead of bullet points, future profiles will emphasize:

* Project narratives
* Learning journeys
* Decision context
* Failures alongside wins

Not just what you did, but **how you think and learn**.

---

## The Irony

We kept shrinking CVs because humans had limited attention.

Now the reader has unlimited attention and perfect recall, yet we’re still writing like it’s 1998.

This won’t last. Over time, recruiters will ask for narratives, timelines, and learning logs instead of just CVs.

And note that I am not talking about future, AI scanning your resume has already been a past narative.

## What You Can Do Now

This change won’t happen overnight, but early adopters will benefit.

Keep the first one or two pages in a conventional CV format for human readers. Then add a separate section — think of it as **detailed notes for AI**.

In this section, don’t worry about length. Add pages that explain your work in depth. Describe each project thoroughly. Capture the problems you faced, the approaches that didn’t work, the trade-offs you made, and what you learned along the way. These details are usually lost, but they matter.

If possible, maintain a weekly or even daily work log. Periodically, you can use AI to summarize these micro-achievements and fold them back into your profile. Given the uncertainty in the job market, this is worth doing even if you are not actively looking for a job.

And for hiring managers — this works for you too.

Take shortlisted CVs, pair them with the job description, and run them through your preferred LLM (let’s be honest, many already do). With your experience layered on top, you can go beyond keyword matching and identify candidates who fit not just the technical requirements, but also the way your organization thinks and operates.

Done right, this becomes a win-win for both candidates and organizations.

## Final Thought

CVs were optimized for human limits.

AI-assisted hiring will reward human depth.

The edge won’t come from tighter bullet points or better keywords, but from clarity of thinking, learning, and intent.

And that doesn’t fit on one page.
