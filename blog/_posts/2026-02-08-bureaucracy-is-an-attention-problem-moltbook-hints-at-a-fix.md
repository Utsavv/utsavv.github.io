title: "Bureaucracy Is an Attention Problem. MoltBook Hints at a Fix"

excerpt: "How MoltBook-style enterprise agents can route attention past bureaucracy, surface real innovations to leadership, and avoid AI-driven micromanagement."

*What if every idea in an enterprise could be heard without bureaucracy killing it first?*

You brought up an idea that you believed could change the course of your enterprise, maybe even the entire industry. You presented that idea, but it got lost from one presentation to another, and other “immediate” priorities ultimately buried it. You sighed and moved on.

This has happened to many of us. One trillion‑dollar example is the story of Google’s *“Attention Is All You Need”* paper. The Google Brain team invented the transformer architecture but underestimated how aggressively it would reshape end‑user products. That paper is now the foundation of the trillion‑dollar modern AI industry.

*Imagine if the famous paper “Attention Is All You Need” was reviewed directly by the CEO.*

Let’s open our chakras and step into a parallel universe where the authors of the paper have an agent that posts their research and achievements on an enterprise social network. At the same time, there are tens—if not hundreds—of research paper summaries published by other employee agents.

In this universe, CEO agents are equipped with the latest and greatest LLMs and sophisticated tools. These CEO agents know about the latest fears discussed in board meetings. They even know about side projects the CEO is personally interested in.

As soon as the author’s agent publishes the paper, the CEO agent notices it and analyzes that it aligns closely with one of the threats discussed in the board meeting. The CEO agent prioritizes this post for the CEO, without any involvement from middle management.

(I know there’s a paradox here—how could all these agents exist without *“Attention Is All You Need”* being published? But hey, we’re in a parallel universe 😉)

These CEO agents can do more than review research papers. They can look into AI‑generated summaries of meetings held in the Ads department. They can examine the latest releases made by small teams. The possibilities are endless, and the level of granularity can be as deep as an enterprise wants.

Over time, these CEO agents can learn through feedback loops and reinforcement learning. They can filter out 99% of the noise and surface the real gems buried deep under layers of enterprise bureaucracy. In this way, the agility of a startup can be brought even to large conglomerates.

And remember, it’s not just the CEO who can have such an agent. CXOs, board members, VPs—everyone can have their own agent aligned with their personal priorities and areas of interest.

I believe the enterprise version of MoltBook—the latest sensation that has taken the internet by storm—is simply waiting to happen. These use cases are no longer sci‑fi; they represent a very plausible near future.

But this is a double‑edged sword.

Implemented thoughtfully, it can fix one of the biggest problems enterprises suffer from: attention being lost in layers of bureaucracy. Implemented poorly, it can turn into AI‑driven micromanagement, where even a small PR reviewed by a CEO agent creates unnecessary noise or pressure for a junior developer.

Like any powerful tool, MoltBook‑style agent systems won’t magically make enterprises better. They will only amplify what the organization already is. The real question is whether enterprises are ready to redesign how attention flows inside them.
